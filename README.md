### Introduction

Consolatrix College of Toledo City Inc. has as one of its top priorities upgrading its facilities and resources to fulfill the mission for which it was founded, which is to provide more pertinent and worthwhile education and training. The Institution grew from a few students in its early years of operation, the school progressively increased its student body and gradually broadened its curriculum options.

On-the-Job Training (OJT), a component of the curriculum in Consolatrix College of Toledo City, aims to teach students about the workplace and their future careers. Currently, the institution offers a wide variety of supplementary courses. This gives students who are academically capable and motivated the chance to begin their career path while still in school. Three participants, namely the students, teachers, and the OJT coordinators, collaborate during the training.

The current procedure for the CCTC, the attendance of OJT Students, is manually writing in a logbook and placing it in a clear book together with its documents during their on-the-job training. And when the OJT students submit printed requirements to the OJT Coordinator, their papers are kept by the coordinator together with the other students. The students will just manually record and print all the tasks given by the coordinator. By doing this, the Coordinator and Students must spend more time, effort, and space keeping track of the OJT students' documents to secure information. Often, manual transactions must be redone rather than just updated when errors occur or when adjustments or corrections are required.

The study's main goal was to demonstrate the benefits of automating the tracking of records for on-the-job trainees. Verifying and keeping track of the trainee's service hours won't be difficult for the OJT Coordinator. A significant number of logbooks, terminal reports, and requirements will also be removed from his or her possession, and there is no risk of losing them. The system will be used to maintain and manage all the trainee’s records.
